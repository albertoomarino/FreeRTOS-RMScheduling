## Introduction

The project aims to allow to get hands-on experience with architecture and operating systems. The name of this project is "HaclOSsim". The assignment involves acquiring proficiency in utilizing an embedded operating system on an ISA simulator, specifically QEMU (https://www.qemu.org/), and customizing it to implement a new, straightforward feature, followed by an evaluation on significant workloads.
Potential operating systems for the project include:
* FreeRTOS (https://www.freertos.org/index.html)
* Erika (https://www.erika-enterprise.com/)
* MicriumOS (https://www.silabs.com/developers/micrium-os)
* RT-Thread (https://www.rt-thread.io/)

The primary objectives of this project are as follows: 
1. Gain proficiency in using QEMU for running an embedded operating system and create a tutorial detailing the installation and usage procedures.
2. Develop practical examples/exercises demonstrating the functionality of the simulator/operating system in alignment with the topics studied in class.
3. Customize the operating system to implement a new solution (e.g., scheduling, memory management, etc.).
4. Evaluate and benchmark the performance improvement achieved by the newly implemented solution.
